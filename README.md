### Vehicle Rental Management System

##Description

The Vehicle Rental Management System is a robust application designed to manage
vehicles, users, and rental records efficiently.
The system enables users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
operations on vehicles, users, and rentals while calculating rental costs dynamically.
Built with JavaFX for the user interface and PostgreSQL for the database, this project employs the MVC architecture to ensure clean, modular, and maintainable code.

##Project Requirements List
1)Add Vehicles: Create and store vehicle records, including details such as type, license plate, and price per day.
2)View Vehicles: Display all stored vehicle records in a dynamic ListView.
3)Update Vehicles: Modify existing vehicle details and synchronize changes with the database.
4)Delete Vehicles: Remove unwanted vehicle records from the system.
5)Add Users: Register new users in the system.
6)View Users: Display the list of registered users dynamically.
7)Add Rentals: Record rental transactions with user and vehicle details, including start and end dates.
8)Calculate Rental Costs: Automatically compute the total rental cost based on the duration and vehicle rate.
9)Validate Inputs: Ensure data accuracy with checks for invalid or missing inputs.
10)Dynamic Updates: Refresh ListViews to display the latest data after any CRUD operation.
